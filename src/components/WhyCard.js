          One night I posted on X that gravity didn't feel strong enough and I
          was going to rewrite its code. Total joke. But then I thought: what if
          I just did?

      </div>
      <div className="whoami-section">
        <p>
          So, it began, as a gag. Then came the rabbit hole. If you touch
          gravity, you end up touching everything else (sus). Spin, orbit, meteor
          showers, asteroids, even global warmin (all coming soon).

          That's really the point: some ideas are too dumb not to build. This
          wasn't about accuracy or usefulness. It was about seeing if a
          ridiculous thought could live as code.

          Hi, I'm Anant. A 19-year-old developer from New Delhi, India. I'm a tech
          geek who loves designing, video editing, and music (even made my own music
          app). Mostly, I follow random ideas until they become something
          tangible â€” whether it's a new AI project, a mini-world, or something
          completely unexpected.
